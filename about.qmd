## Bio

Physician turned engineer. I trained in medicine, missed the door to radiology, and walked through another one — into public health, clinical informatics, and eventually software. Now I build things and think about how technology shapes policy (and vice versa).

I'm drawn to problems that don't fit neatly into one field. The messier the intersection, the more interesting.

Based in France. Fluent in several languages, still learning others.

## Expertise

- Medicine & Public Health
- Software Engineering

## Consulting

I help organizations tackle niche and complex interdisciplinary problems. If you have a challenging project that doesn't fit neatly into traditional categories, [let's talk](contact.qmd).
