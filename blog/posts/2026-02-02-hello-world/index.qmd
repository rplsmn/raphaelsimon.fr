Welcome to my blog! This is where I'll share thoughts on medicine, public health, software engineering, data science, and the interesting problems that emerge at their intersections.

## What to Expect

Topics will vary widely - that's by design. I'm interested in:

- **Medicine & Public Health**: Clinical insights, health systems, epidemiology
- **Software Engineering**: Architecture, best practices, tools
- **Data Science**: Analysis methods, visualization, ML applications
- **Complex Systems**: Where these fields collide

## Why Write?

Writing clarifies thinking. By explaining ideas publicly, I'm forced to refine them.

Stay tuned for more.
